Products.GenericSetup
=====================

This product provides a mini-framework for expressing the configured
state of a Zope Site as a set of filesystem artifacts.  These artifacts
consist of declarative XML files, which spell out the configuration
settings for each "tool" in the site , and supporting scripts / templates,
in their "canonical" filesystem representations.

See https://productsgenericsetup.readthedocs.io/ for full documentation.
